# Shopping Behavior Prediction

Developed a machine learning model to predict online shopping behaviors. The objective was to determine whether a user would complete a purchase based on their browsing session data. 

The k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN) algorithm effectively distinguishied between purchasing and non-purchasing sessions. 

This project honed my skills in data preprocessing, feature selection, and the practical application of k-NN for classification tasks.
