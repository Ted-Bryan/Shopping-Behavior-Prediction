# 🛒 Shopping Behavior Prediction

## 🎯 Objective  
Predict whether a user would complete a purchase based on their **online browsing session data**.

## 🧠 Approach  
Implemented the **k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN)** algorithm to classify sessions as:  
- ✅ **Purchasing**  
- ❌ **Non-purchasing**

## 🔧 Key Contributions  
- 🧹 **Data Preprocessing**  
- 🧬 **Feature Selection**  
- 🤖 **Applied k-NN for Classification**

## 🚀 Outcome  
Successfully developed a model that **effectively distinguishes** between buying and non-buying behavior, strengthening my machine learning skills in real-world contexts.

## 🛠️ Toolbox
- Python 🐍
- pandas 📊
- scikit-learn 🤖
